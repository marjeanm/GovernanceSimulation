# GovernanceSimulation

A real-world simulation of MFA enforcement and token lifecycle governance using Microsoft Entra ID. Includes forensic case analysis, SOPs, Zero Trust policy design, and role-based IAM auditing aligned to NIST SP 800-53 and SOX.

This repository documents a full-scale governance simulation focused on Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) rollout, token re-registration failures, and enforcement strategy using Microsoft Entra ID.

Built from real-world test environments, this project includes:

A forensic investigation of ghost MFA token behavior

Zero Trust policy enforcement using Conditional Access

SOPs for stale token removal and rebind procedures

Device baseline controls and audit logging playbooks

Role-based access audits aligned with NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 and SOX
