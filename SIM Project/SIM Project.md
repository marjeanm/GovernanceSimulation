# 🧠 SIM Project : MFA Rollout + Token Lifecycle Governance

**Author:** Marjean Mayo-Baker  
**Status:** ✅ Complete (Phase 1–3)  
**Frameworks:** NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5, SOX, MITRE ATT&CK for Mobile  
**Project Type:** Governance Simulation (No-code, Real-world Replication)

---

## 📌 Objective
This simulation documents a full Zero Trust-aligned Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) governance rollout using Microsoft Entra ID. It includes a forensic deep dive into token leakage, stale authenticator behavior, recovery loop failure, and policy enforcement breakdowns. All outputs are compliance-aligned and ready for executive, audit, or engineering handoff.

## ✅ Simulation Highlights
- 🔐 **Real Entra ID tenant** used for testing token ghost behavior
- 🔁 Simulated **SSPR recovery loop failure** and stale MFA token residue
- 📊 Aligned all artifacts to **NIST SP 800-53**, SOX, and **MITRE ATT&CK (Mobile)**
- 🧠 Emphasis on *governance maturity, operational clarity, and reproducibility*
- 🛡️ Recommendations provided for Zero Trust, cloud sync disablement, backup lockout, and RBAC enforcement

---

## 🔖 How to Use
- 💼 Present to security leadership as an end-to-end MFA risk scenario
- 🧪 Replicate for internal lab training (Red vs Blue + Audit)
- 📁 Import into Notion, GitHub, or Obsidian as part of the `Forge_SIM` library
- ✍🏽 Use as writing samples for GRC roles or cybersecurity job applications

---

## 🧭 Next Phase
- ✅ Phase 1: Complete
- ✅ Phase 2: Complete
- ✅ Phase 3: Complete
- ⏭️ Upcoming SIM Focus: Data Governance or Endpoint Forensics
